# Othello-AI

> An implementation of the game Othello(Reversi) using pygame including AI with Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

## Usage

At first, you need to install pygame.

```shell
$ pip3 install pygame --user
```

You can play with your friend by running Othello-PVP.py.

```shell
$ python3 Othello-PVP.py
```

You can play against AI by running Othello-AI.py or Othello-AI-Pruning.py.

Othello-AI-Pruning.py is more difficult than Othello-AI.py.

```shell
$ python3 Othello-AI.py
$ python3 Othello-AI-Pruning.py
```

You are the black player. Black first.

Then click anywhere, AI will put down a chess.
